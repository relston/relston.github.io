Hello! I'm Ryan Elston. With over a decade of experience under my keyboard, I've been architecting fault-tolerant, high-throughput services that scale smoothly. I've got a knack for turning complex problems into sleek, efficient solutions. 

I love note taking in markdown, and scripting solutions. I'm tinkering with LLM to help automate as much of my life as I can. Using AI for personal creativity and productivity is my focus.

When I'm not buried in code, I call Arvada, Colorado my home, enjoying the breathtaking views and the occasional mountain hike.

Let’s engineer the future together! 🚀👨‍💻
